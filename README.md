# Simple-Chat-App-Python-Tkinter-
This is a beginner-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) chat application built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It allows a user to type messages, send them, and receive a basic automated response from a bot. The bot currently echoes back the user's message, making this project a great starting point for building more advanced chatbots.
